Hello everyone! Thank you for taking the time to
check out this project!

Since this project was the first one I attempted 
that involved some Javascript, I am incredibly proud
of it.

I had a little trouble finding the best way
to store the button text within a variable
so I could update the text in the "thank
you state".

I just went ahead and used eventlisteners on each button..
But there has to be a simpler way to handle this.
if you can give me any tips in that department,
it would be greatly appreciated!

I think this is the best job I have done with centering
the card container. If there are any improvement in
this area, please let me know!

Once again, thank you!!! - Roque Rodriguez.
